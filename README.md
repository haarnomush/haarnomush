## 👋 Hi there!

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Eva, a student-athlete currently studying **Statistics** at **Harvard College**!

🎓 Academically, I’m interested in topics like **predictive modeling**, **data science**, and **quantitative finance**. 

💭 I recently completed a personal project to use historical data to **predict the future price of Bitcoin**. I was inspired to tackle this project by the recent spikes in cryptocurrency prices and the high volatility in the space. I really enjoyed exploring this topic and definitly look to come back to this and refine it in the future!

🚣 Outside tech, I enjoy pretty much anything that is active, especially rowing! I am member of the **Varsity Lightweight Rowing Team** at Harvard. I also like to run, lift, and just be outside. I am also a massive foodie that loves trying cool new places.

📚 When it comes to reading, I gravitate toward books on **strategy**, **self-improvement**, and **analytical thinking**, with a soft spot for **historical fiction**.  
Most recently, I read:  
- [Decision-Driven Analytics: Leveraging Human Intelligence to Unlock the Power of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Driven-Analytics-Leveraging-Intelligence-Unlock/dp/1613631715) by Bart De Langhe and Stefano Puntoni
- [Elon Musk](https://www.audiobooks.com/audiobook/elon-musk/669289?refId=38712&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20802767249&gbraid=0AAAAADzSbyIveEbU_IcigcQl1AA-WGncU&gclid=CjwKCAjwp_LDBhBCEiwAK7FnkpgTNfPFXsLrJVC0HQ0iGYiZDAXnBa9UPZIhP3MUF9CEJpUNE2HHcxoCVrwQAvD_BwE) by Walter Isaacson


🌍 I love traveling as well! 🇧🇬 🇫🇷 🇧🇸 🇬🇹 🇹🇨 🇨🇦
